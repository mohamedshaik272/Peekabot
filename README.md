# Peekabot: Smart Home Monitoring Robot
For HackOverflow 2024

## Overview:
Peekabot is a cloud-connected robot built with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, designed to improve home safety. It tracks movement using vSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and sends real-time alerts when potential dangers are detected, such as a toddler wandering into unsafe areas, an elderly person falling, or an intruder entering your home.

## Features:
- **vSLAM Tracking**: Real-time tracking of people and objects within the environment.
- **Text Alerts**: Instantly notifies you via text if an issue arises (e.g., toddler in a danger zone, elderly fall, or home intrusion).
- **Versatile Use**: Peekabot is designed for monitoring, but can act as your personal companion too. 

## Future Features:
- **Advanced AI Integration**: Predictive alerts to notify you before risky behavior occurs.
- **Home Automation**: Seamless integration with other smart home devices like lights and locks.
